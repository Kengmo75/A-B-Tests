#Food and Drinks Banner A/B Test Analysis üçîü•§
Welcome to the Food and Drinks Banner A/B Test Analysis repository! This project aims to help decide whether or not to launch a food and drinks banner on the company's website through an A/B test. Users are randomly assigned to either a control group (no banner) or a treatment group (with banner), and their behavior is analyzed to make informed decisions.

#Introduction
Launching new features on a website requires careful consideration and analysis to ensure its effectiveness and impact on user behavior. This project conducts an A/B test to evaluate the impact of a food and drinks banner on the company's website.

#Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the data is cleaned to remove null values, duplicates, or any missing values that could skew the results. Data integrity is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making.

#SQL Query
SQL queries are used to filter out specific data that will be useful for analysis. This involves extracting relevant information from the database to conduct meaningful analysis.

#Data Visualization with Tableau
Visualizing the data using Tableau helps in understanding specific trends, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into user behavior. Visualizations such as confidence intervals and trend analysis are created to facilitate decision-making.

#Hypothesis Testing with Excel
Excel is utilized to carry out hypothesis tests and calculate confidence intervals. Statistical analysis helps in determining the significance of the results and making data-driven decisions.

#Power Analysis
Power analysis is performed to understand the required sample size needed to run the experiment effectively. This ensures that the experiment has sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences between groups.
